Project for Operating Systems and Laboratory course at the University of Pisa. The project aim is to realize a simulation of a system that models a supermarket. The supermarket behaviour depens on some default values that can be found in ./config/config.txt, the explanation of what they represent is in ./Readme/readme.txt. The supermarket.c process simulate cashiers and customers behaviour with a multithread implementation and communication between supermarket.c process and manager.c process is implemented with an AF_UNIX socket.
